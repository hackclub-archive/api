    # Commenting because this method's name is somewhat confusing. Please rename

    # This method updates the message that triggered action with the passed in
    # message contents. It uses action's special response_url attribute to
    # update the source message without leaving a note in the user's Slack
    # client saying that the source message was edited, making the UX of the
    # edit much nicer.
    #
    # The whole behavior of response_url can be quite confusing and difficult to
    # understand -- the first thing to understand is that the request format is
    # different from regular Web API calls and, therefore, can't be used with
    # our current SlackClient implementation.
