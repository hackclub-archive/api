greeting:
    if_first_check_in: |
        Hey <%= first_name %>! I'm Hackbot, Hack Club's friendly robot helper.

        I'll be reaching out to you every week, typically on Fridays, to check in and see how your club's doing. I'll be in the loop every step of the way :slightly_smiling_face:

        To start, did you have a club meeting this week?
    default: Hey <%= first_name %>! Let's get started — please be sure to complete this check-in by <%= deadline %>. Did your club meet this week?

meeting_confirmation:
    had_meeting:
        action_result: ":white_check_mark: *You had a meeting*"
        ask_day_of_week: Okay, sweet! On which day was it? (say something like "monday" or "today" – I'm not very clever)
    no_meeting:
        action_result: ":no_entry: *You did not have a meeting*"
        ask_why: That's a shame! Why didn't you meet?
    invalid: I'm not very smart yet and had trouble understanding you :-/. Try saying something like 'yes' or 'no'.

no_meeting_reason: Gotcha. Are you planning on having a club meeting in the future?

meeting_in_the_future:
    positive: Gotcha, is there anything preventing you from having your next meeting? If not, please respond with "no".
    negative: That's a shame. I'll let the Hack Club team know.
    invalid: I'm not very smart yet and had trouble understanding you :-/. Try saying something like 'yes' or 'no'

help:
    Got it! Have a hack-tastic weekend!

day_of_week:
    unknown: :disappointed: I'm not very smart yet and had trouble understanding you. Try saying something simpler, like "tuesday" or "thursday".
    invalid: Hmm, that date didn't happen in the past week (although I may be misunderstanding you). Can you try giving me the day of the week of your meeting again?
    valid: How many people would you estimate came? (I'm not very smart, I'll need you to give me a single number, something like "25" – give your best estimate)

judgement:
    ok: Nice!
    good: <%= count %> is a number to be proud of!
    great: Damn, <%= count %> is a huge number of people!
    awesome: I have no words. <%= count %> people is incredible!
    impossible: I'm speechless. That's incredible.

attendance:
    invalid: I didn't quite understand that. Can you try giving a single number?
    not_realistic: I'm going to need a positive number, silly. How many people came to the last meeting?
    valid: <%= judgement %> Is there anything the Hack Club team can be helpful with?

notes_confirmation:
    has_notes:
        action_result: ":white_check_mark: *You could use help from the Hack Club team*"
        ask: What should I send to them?
    no_notes:
        action_result: ":no_entry: *You don't need any help right now*"
        goodbye: Okay. Hope you have a hack-tastic weekend!

notes:
  had_notes: Gotcha, I'll pass that on to <@U1S56LC05>! Hope you have a hack-tastic weekend!

follow_ups:
    first: "Hey! Just wanted to follow-up on this. :wink:"
    second: "Ping. :wave:"
    third: "Just a heads up – this is the last ping I'll send. :airplane_departure:"
