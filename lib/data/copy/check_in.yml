first_greeting: |
    Hey <%= first_name %>! I'm Hackbot, Hack Club's friendly robot helper.

    I'll be reaching out to you every week, typically on Fridays, to check in and see how your club's doing. I'll be in the loop every step of the way :slightly_smiling_face:

    To start, did you have a club meeting this week?

greeting: Hey <%= first_name %>! Let's get started — please be sure to complete this check-in by <%= deadline %>. Did your club meet this week?

meeting_confirmation:
    positive: Okay, sweet! On which day was it? (say something like "monday" or "today" – I'm not very clever)
    negative: That's a shame! Why didn't the meeting happen?

no_meeting_reason: Gotcha. Are you planning on having a club meeting in the future?

meeting_in_the_future:
    positive: Gotcha, is there anything preventing you from having your next meeting?
    negative: That's a shame. I'll let the Hack Club team know.

meeting_prevent_reason: What is preventing your club from meeting?

help:
    Got it! Have a hack-tastic weekend!

day_of_week:
    unknown: Man, I'm not very smart yet and had trouble understanding you. Try saying something simpler, like "tuesday" or "thursday".
    invalid: Hmm, that date didn't happen in the past week (although I may be misunderstanding you). Can you try giving me the day of the week of your meeting again?
    valid: How many people would you estimate came? (I'm not very smart, I'll need you to give me a single number, something like "25" – give your best estimate)

judgement:
    ok: Nice!
    good: <%= count %> is a number to be proud of!
    great: Damn, <%= count %> is a huge number of people!
    awesome: I have no words. <%= count %> people is incredible!
    impossible: I'm speechless. That's incredible.

attendance:
    invalid: I didn't quite understand that. Can you try giving a single number?
    not_realistic: I'm going to need a positive number, silly. How many people came to the last meeting?
    valid: <%= judgement %> Is there anything the Hack Club team can be helpful with? I'll send them anything you send my way (just make sure to include everything in a single message). If not, please respond with "no".

notes:
    no_notes: Okay. Hope you have a hack-tastic weekend!
    had_notes: Gotcha, I'll pass that on to <@U1S56LC05>! Hope you have a hack-tastic weekend!

follow_ups:
    first: "Hey! Just wanted to follow-up on this. :wink:"
    second: "Ping. :wave:"
    third: "Just a heads up – this is the last ping I'll send. :airplane_departure:"
