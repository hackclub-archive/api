    Hey <%= info[:name] %>! Noticed you just filled out the intake form â€“ welcome to Hack Club! My name is Hackbot, I'm our Slack's friendly robotic helper.

    Here's some things I know how to do:

    * Fetch GIFs. `hackbot gif <search-term-here>`
    * Retrieve club stats (you'll need to have some club meetings before this is useful to you, though!). `hackbot stats`

    As you can tell I'm pretty basic right now, but I learn new things every week. In fact, if you have any suggestions just talk to `@harrison` or `@msw`!

    If you're the point of contact (Kyle should explain what this is), I'll be reaching out to you every week on Friday to find out the latest information about your club.

    Happy hacking!
