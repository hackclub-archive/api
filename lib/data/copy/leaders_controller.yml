    Hey <%= info[:name] %>! Noticed you just filled out the intake form â€“ welcome to Hack Club! My name is Hackbot, I'm our Slack's friendly robotic helper.

    I currently only know how to do a few things. Firstly, I can get GIFs for you with `hackbot gif <search-term-here`. Secondly, once you've got a few meetings under your belt I can give you stats breakdowns with `hackbot gif stats`

    As you can tell I'm pretty basic right now, but I learn new things every week. In fact, if you have any suggestions just talk to `@harrison` or `@msw`!

    If you're the point of contact (Kyle should explain what this is), I'll be reaching out to you every week on Friday to find out the latest information about your club.

    Happy hacking!
