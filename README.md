__*Warning: This repository has been combined with [`hackclub/monolith`](https://github.com/hackclub/monolith)*__

## Setup

After cloning the repository, run the following commands:

```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run web bundle install
$ docker-compose run web rails db:create
$ docker-compose run web rails db:migrate
$ docker-compose up
```

And then the server should be live!

## Configuration

## Other Setup

Dumping this stuff here for lack of a better place.

### Setting up the Slack App

1. Create a new Slack app on Slack
2. Create one (and only one) bot user and set "Always Show My Bot as Online" to "On"
3. Click "Event Subscriptions" on the sidebar in the left and set the request URL to `HOSTNAME/v1/hackbot/webhooks/events`, replacing `HOSTNAME` with your actual hostname.
4. Subscribe to the following bot events: `message.channels`, `message.im`, `message.groups`, `message.mpim`
5. Click "Interactive Messages" on the left sidebar and set the request URL to `HOSTNAME/v1/hackbot/webhooks/interactive_messages`, replacing `HOSTNAME` with your actual hostname.

### Scheduled Jobs

This application depends on a few jobs running periodically in the background. Set this up using cron or a similar scheduler on your deployment of the application -- we use Heroku's scheduler in production.

- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_update_from_streak` every hour
- `rails heroku_scheduler:queue_update_hackbot_slack_username` every hour

## Deployment on Heroku

We use Heroku for managing our deployment of this project and that brings along some special caveats. Specifically, we rely on multiple buildpacks.

Here are the buildpacks that need to be configured (they must be in the given order):

```
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt
heroku/ruby
```

Refer to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks for instructions on configuring buildpacks.
