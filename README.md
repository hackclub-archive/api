## Setup

After cloning the repository, run the following commands:

```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run web rails db:create
$ docker-compose run web rails db:migrate
$ docker-compose up
```

And then the server should be live!

## Configuration

The following configuration options are available:

```
# Number of Rails threads to run per server instance. One database connection is
# made per thread (ex. if this is set to 5, then the database connection pool
# will hold 5 connections).
RAILS_MAX_THREADS

# Port to listen for HTTP requests on
PORT

# Environment to run Rails in (can be "development", "test", or "production")
RAILS_ENV

# URL of Postgres instance to connect to. Rails will automatically connect to
# Docker Compose's instance of Postgres if this isn't set.
